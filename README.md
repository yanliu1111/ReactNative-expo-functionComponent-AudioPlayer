# ReactNative-expo-functionComponent-Local AudioPlayer

This Local AudioPlayer tutorial I learned from Youtuber [Niraj Dhungana](https://ndpniraj.com/blogs/audio-player-using-expo-react-native)

I use function component instead of the tutorial class component. I learn a lot from his tutorial and learn a lot when I am working on optimization, learned the different between function and class components.

This audio app development is kept adding more features ... 😁
For now, it works for basic music play 🎵

## Running the Audio App

Run

```
expo start
```
