# ReactNative-expo-functionComponent-AudioPlayer

This AudioPlayer tutorial I learned from Youtuber [Niraj Dhungana](https://ndpniraj.com/blogs/audio-player-using-expo-react-native)

I use function component instead of the tutorial class component. I learn a lot from his tutorial and learn a lot the different between function and class components.

This audio app development continue ... üòÅ add more features
For now, it works

## Running the Audio App

Run

```
expo start
```
